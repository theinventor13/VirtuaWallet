*The absolutely fucking useless finance software no one asked for*

I did this trash during a compsci class as a sick joke after my professor made us code a program to calculate dollars and cents given nickels and pennies. This code is an example of how pedantic and incredibly stupid object oriented programming methodologies are, and how unreadable and bloated they make otherwise simple code.
